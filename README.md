# Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning Project

Part A: The objective is to build a machine learning model to predict the signal quality of a communication equipment using various parameters. The project involves data import, understanding, preprocessing, and training a neural network classifier to achieve this goal.

Part B: The aim is to develop a digit classifier using the Street View Housing Number (SVHN) dataset. The project entails data import, exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and training a neural network classifier to accurately recognize digits in natural scene images captured by Google Street View.
